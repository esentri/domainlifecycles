# DomainLifeCycles (DLC) — llms.txt

## What this project is
DomainLifeCycles (DLC) is an opinionated set of Java libraries for building business applications using Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
It focuses on helping developers expressing rich domain models, express business rules explicitly, and keep the domain model conceptually clean — while integrating smoothly with the Java ecosystem (Spring, Jakarta EE, Jackson, jOOQ).

The main goal is to accelerate tactical DDD design and implementation in Java
with shortcuts for infrastructure concerns and boilerplate code reduction.

## Core principles / opinions
DLC is built around these guiding ideas:

- Convention over configuration, but with escape hatches
- Explicit behavior (domain logic should be visible in code, not hidden in magic)
- Type-based domain modeling (rich types representing real domain concepts)
- Providing types representing core DDD concepts:
- AggregateRoot
  - Entity
  - ValueObject
  - DomainEvent
  - DomainService
  - repository
- Extend DDD building blocks with additional explicit architectural types:
  - ApplicationServices
  - DomainCommands
  - ReadModels
  - QueryHandlers
  - OutboundServices
- Concept transparency:
  - Clear tactical structure
  - Domain diagrams can be generated directly from code
- Modular and independent:
  - Use only the parts you want
- Integratable by design:
  - Works well with Spring and Jakarta EE. Spring Boot starter included.

## Main features / modules
DLC consists of several independent modules (JARs), typically used together via a starter.

Key features:

1. Domain Types
   - Marker interfaces / base classes for DDD building blocks
   - Makes tactical design explicit in Java
   - Foundation for metadata and the Domain Mirror

2. Domain Mirror
   - Reflective metamodel of bounded contexts
   - Structural queries and navigation of aggregates/entities/value objects
   - Simplified reflective access on instance values

3. Domain Object Builders
   - Builder pattern support
   - Complements DDD factories
   - Optional Lombok compatibility

4. JSON Mapping (Jackson)
   - Jackson-based mapping for DDD building blocks
   - Supports Jackson 3 (recommended) and optional Jackson 2 legacy integration
   - Spring-compatible
   - Customizable via MappingCustomizer API
   - Optional DB-sequence-based ID provisioning

5. Persistence
   - Simplified ORM for persisted domain objects
   - Type-safe queries using jOOQ
   - Supports multiple relational DB dialects (via jOOQ)
   - Aggregate CRUD support (repositories)
   - Aggregate fetch support, simplified queries (fetcher)
   - Supports final fields and Java Optional
   - Full ValueObject persistence support
   - Persistence action event hooks

6. Domain Events
   - Simplifies publishing and listening
   - Static DomainEvents.publish() API
   - @ListensTo annotation for routing
   - Optional Spring event bus integration
   - Optional transactional outbox support

7. Validation
   - DomainAssertion API for invariants and business rules
   - Optional Jakarta Bean Validation support inside domain objects
   - Optional Byte Buddy extension for an "always-valid" strategy

8. Spring Integration
   - Spring Boot autoconfiguration via @EnableDLC
   - Spring Web support (IDs and single-valued ValueObjects as query/path params)
   - Spring events + Spring Modulith events support
   - SpringDoc OpenAPI extensions aligned with DLC JSON mapping
   - Autoconfiguration for persistence + JSON mapping

9. Plugins
   - Build-time generation of domain diagrams

## Getting started
Start here:
- Getting Started Guide:

- Concepts overview:
  ./concepts/readme.md

For a full working example:
- Sample project:
  ./sample-project

## Recommended dependency setup
For Spring Boot 4.x apps:
- io.domainlifecycles:spring-boot-starter:3.0.0

For Spring Boot 3.x apps:
- io.domainlifecycles:spring-boot3-starter:3.0.0

These starters pull in the appropriate DLC modules and integrations.

## External dependencies commonly required
Depending on which DLC features are used, typical external runtime libraries include:

- Lombok (optional builder support)
- classgraph (runtime class loading for mirror/persistence)
- Hibernate Validator or other Jakarta Bean Validation provider
- Byte Buddy (always-valid validation extender)
- jOOQ (persistence)
- Jackson 3 or Jackson 2 (JSON mapping / event serialization)
- SpringDoc OpenAPI (OpenAPI integration)
- Spring Transaction (Spring-based domain events)
- JTA provider (for Jakarta JTA domain event support)
- Gruelbox Transactional Outbox (optional)
- ActiveMQ (optional)
- SLF4J logging provider (required by DLC)

## What an LLM should know when answering questions about DLC
When explaining or generating code using DLC:
- Prefer explicit domain behavior (methods, invariants, lifecycle transitions).
- Prefer type-based modeling: create dedicated types for domain concepts rather than generic strings/UUIDs.
- Treat aggregates, entities, and value objects as first-class DDD structures.
- Use DomainAssertions (or validation) for invariants.
- Use DomainEvents.publish() and @DomainEventListener where domain events are relevant.
- Use jOOQ-based persistence  rather than JPA-style ORM assumptions.
- For Spring-based projects, assume DLC starter + autoconfig is preferred.

## What this project is NOT
- Not a replacement for DDD — it is a set of libraries to implement tactical DDD more cleanly in Java.
- Not a “magic annotation framework” that hides domain behavior behind reflection.
- Not monolithic: modules are intentionally independent.
