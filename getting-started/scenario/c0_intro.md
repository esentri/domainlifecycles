# Getting Started with DLC

---

Learn the essential DDD concepts — and how DLC helps you apply them effortlessly.

## Introduction

Imagine you’re tasked with building a simple online shop for Emma, a small business owner who sells handmade products.
You reach for your favorite Spring Boot setup — a few entities, some controllers, maybe a service layer.
It works at first, but as Emma’s business rules grow, the codebase starts to tangle.

Where should domain logic live?
How do you keep persistence separate from your core model?
And how do you make sure that “Emma’s business language” — her products, customers, and orders — doesn’t get buried under technical details?

That’s where DLC comes in.

DLC is a lightweight framework designed to help you build applications that follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles — without drowning in boilerplate or complexity.

In this tutorial, you’ll develop Emma’s online webshop step by step. Along the way, you’ll learn how DLC makes it easy to define aggregates, entities, and repositories, while keeping your domain pure and expressive.

By the end, you’ll have a running Spring Boot web application — and a clear sense of how DDD feels when it’s done right.
